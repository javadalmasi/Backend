# Piped-Backend with Integrated Dynamic Proxy Support - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to integrate dynamic proxy support directly into the Piped-Backend application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Application Integration

#### Modified Files:
1. **`src/main/java/me/kavin/piped/Main.java`**
   - Integrated proxy manager startup directly into the main application flow
   - Removed conditional check for ENABLE_DYNAMIC_PROXY since proxy is now always enabled
   - Added proper shutdown hooks for proxy cleanup

2. **`src/main/java/me/kavin/piped/consts/Constants.java`**
   - Set `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_PROXY = true` by default
   - Added `DYNAMIC_PROXY_PORT` configuration option
   - Made proxy functionality a core part of the application

3. **`src/main/java/me/kavin/piped/proxy/*.java`**
   - Created complete proxy management system with five core components:
     - `ProxyFetcher.java` - Fetches and decodes proxy configurations
     - `ProxyHealthChecker.java` - Validates working proxies
     - `ProxyManager.java` - Coordinates all proxy components
     - `Socks5ProxyServer.java` - Implements SOCKS5 proxy server with load balancing
     - `ProxyModuleTest.java` - Basic testing framework

### 2. Configuration Updates

#### Modified Files:
1. **`config.properties`**
   - Added `DYNAMIC_PROXY_PORT=1080` configuration
   - Documented proxy settings in comments
   - Made proxy functionality clear and configurable

2. **`README.md`**
   - Updated to reflect that proxy is enabled by default
   - Added information about SOCKS5 proxy on port 1080

### 3. Docker Integration

#### Modified Files:
1. **`Dockerfile`**
   - Added `EXPOSE 1080` to expose proxy port
   - Ensured VERSION file is available for Docker build
   - Maintained compatibility with existing build process

2. **`docker-compose.yml`**
   - Updated to expose both ports 8080 (main app) and 1080 (proxy)
   - Added environment variables for proxy configuration
   - Switched back to using pre-built image for simplicity

### 4. Documentation

#### Added Files:
1. **`README-PROXY.md`** - Comprehensive documentation of proxy functionality
2. **`PROXY-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`** - Technical details of implementation

#### Modified Files:
1. **`README.md`** - Updated to reflect integrated proxy functionality

### 5. Utility Scripts

#### Added Files:
1. **`build-proxy.sh`** - Build script for enhanced version
2. **`start-proxy.sh`** - Startup script with proxy configuration

## Key Features Now Available By Default

1. **Automatic Proxy Rotation** - Fetches fresh proxy lists every 10 minutes from multiple sources
2. **Multi-Protocol Support** - Works with VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks, and XHTTP protocols
3. **Health Checking** - Continuously validates proxies to ensure only working ones are used
4. **Load Balancing** - Distributes requests evenly across working proxies using round-robin
5. **SOCKS5 Interface** - Provides standard SOCKS5 proxy interface on port 1080
6. **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box with default docker-compose deployment

## Usage

After deployment with `docker-compose up -d`:
- Main application API: http://localhost:8080
- SOCKS5 Proxy for applications: localhost:1080

Applications can connect through the SOCKS5 proxy at `localhost:1080` to benefit from rotating IPs that automatically refresh every 10 minutes, without any additional configuration needed.

## Technical Architecture

The proxy system consists of five main components:

1. **ProxyFetcher** - Retrieves base64-encoded proxy configurations from subscription URLs
2. **ProxyHealthChecker** - Tests connectivity of each proxy to maintain a healthy pool
3. **Socks5ProxyServer** - Implements SOCKS5 protocol with round-robin load balancing
4. **ProxyManager** - Coordinates all components and manages the update cycle
5. **Main Application** - Integrates proxy manager startup into application flow

## Configuration

The system is configured through environment variables or config.properties:

- `DYNAMIC_PROXY_PORT` - Port for SOCKS5 proxy server (default: 1080)

## Subscription Sources

The system fetches proxies from these sources every 10 minutes:
- VLESS: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsyebekhe/PSG/main/subscriptions/xray/base64/vless
- VMess: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsyebekhe/PSG/main/subscriptions/xray/base64/vmess
- Trojan: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsyebekhe/PSG/main/subscriptions/xray/base64/trojan
- Shadowsocks: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsyebekhe/PSG/main/subscriptions/xray/base64/ss
- XHTTP: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsyebekhe/PSG/main/subscriptions/xray/base64/xhttp

## Benefits

1. **Privacy Enhancement** - Rotating IPs help prevent tracking
2. **Geographic Flexibility** - Access content from different regions
3. **Rate Limit Avoidance** - Distributed requests across multiple endpoints
4. **Automatic Maintenance** - Self-updating proxy lists with health monitoring
5. **Zero Configuration** - Works immediately with default deployment
6. **Transparent Integration** - No changes needed to existing application code
